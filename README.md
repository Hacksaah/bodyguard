# Bodyguard
## By: Drew Waters, Joseph Saah, and Tyler Smith

Bodyguard is a game where the player must defend a target from randomly spawned bullets. The player is a small square with basic movement and the ability to fall quickly to the ground by pressing down. They are unaffected by the bullets and can destroy them by ramming into them. The thing they must protect is a larger yellow circle that moves about randomly. The bullets are boids and target the circle through an attraction force. With their slightly enhanced movement, the player must destroy bullets to defend the sphere as long as possible.
